# AFK clicker

A simple AFK clicker that allow to simulate keystrokes (mouse or keyboard) even if the window isn't focused.

Tested on windows using notepad and minecraft (afk fish farm :D).  
Tested on linux using minecraft.  

If you tested in another game/application please let me know opening an issue or even contribuiting making a pull request.  

## Windows Usage

### Updated with a powershell wrapper to help you find the right window
Just run either of the shortcuts `AFK Clicker - Right` or `AFK Clicker - Left` from the windows directory


Just take the application PID from the task manager and call as `python Main.py -p PID_NUMBER`.  
Or you can use the application name from task manager and call as `python Main.py -n "APPLICATION NAME"`, remember that applications can have more than one name, take minecraft for example, in task manager you see as `Java(TM) Platform SE binary` but if you place this name it'll get an error while if you expand the task (an arrow beside its name) it'll show `Minecraft 1.13.2` and that'll work.  
Use the argument option `-m` or `--mouse` to choose the right or left click (1 for left and 2 for right).  
Use the option `-k` or `--key` to choose the keyboard key [Link to the list of windows virtual keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/inputdev/virtual-key-codes). Use the hexadecimal code, example, `--key 0x46`.  
Use command `python Main.py -h` or `python Main.py --help` to show some help with command line arguments.  
If you run without the `-k` or `-m` option, it'll do nothing. (modify the code as it suits you).  
For minecraft users: press F3 + p to disable the pause menu when you change the focus (use windows key or alt + tab to change window).

## Windows Requirements

Python 3 (tested with 3.7).  
For libraries check the file `requirements.txt` or run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Linux Usage

Run the command `./script.sh WINDOW_NAME MOUSE_BUTTON` or `bash script.sh WINDOW_NAME MOUSE_BUTTON`.  
If you are having any trouble try `chmod +x script.sh` to make it executable.

## Linux Requirements

xdotool. Tested on manjaro.
